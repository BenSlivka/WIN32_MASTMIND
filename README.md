# WIN32_MASTMIND
12/22/199: A MasterMind(R) game I wrote for fun for Win16 in 1991, and then updated to run on Windows 95. The file mastmind.exe still runs on Windows 10 today (2/9/2021)

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game) for more details on the game (I didn't include rules in my Windows application).
